# OpenFin Notification Center

## Overview

The OpenFin Notification Center provides developers with a uniform way to create, display and organize desktop notifications as well as responding to notification events.

Notifications will be displayed as toasts as well as being listed and organized in a Notification Center. The Notification Center can be accessed by clicking on the Notifications icon in the system tray.

This project consist of 2 parts:

1. The Notification Center, displaying and managing notifications
2. The Notification Center Client Library, exposing APIs for applications to create and manage notifications

### Dependencies

- OpenFin version for applications using the Notification Center >= 9.61.38.41
- OpenFin version used by the Notifications Provider = 14.78.45.31
- RVM >= 4.7

### Features

- Create notifications
- Clear and dismiss notifications
- Attach handlers for when notifications are created, closed, and interacted with
- Persist notifications in the Notification Center

## Getting Started

Integrating the Notification Center within an application is done by importing the Client API.

### Import the Client API

```bash
npm install openfin-notifications
```

The client library is also available as a resource which can be included via `<script>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.openfin.co/services/openfin/notifications/<VERSION>/openfin-notifications.js"></script>
```

This will expose the global variable `notifications` with the API methods documented in the link below. Example:

```js
const notes = await notifications.getAll();
```

The client module exports a set of functions, documented in the [API docs](https://cdn.openfin.co/docs/services/notifications/stable/api/).

### Usage

Documentation is available [here](https://developers.openfin.co/docs/notifications-api).
