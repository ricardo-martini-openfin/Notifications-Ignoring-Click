/**
 * @typedef {object} ApplicationOption
 * @summary Application creation options.
 * @desc This is the options object required by {@link Application.start Application.start}.
 *
 * The following options are required:
 * * `uuid` is required in the app manifest as well as by {@link Application.start Application.start}
 * * `name` is optional in the app manifest but required by {@link Application.start Application.start}
 * * `url` is optional in both the app manifest {@link Application.start Application.start} and  but is usually given
 * (defaults to `"about:blank"` when omitted).
 *
 * _This jsdoc typedef mirrors the `ApplicationOption` TypeScript interface in `@types/openfin`._
 *
 * **IMPORTANT NOTE:**
 * This object inherits all the properties of the window creation {@link Window~options options} object,
 * which will take priority over those of the same name that may be provided in `mainWindowOptions`.
 *
 * @property {boolean} [disableIabSecureLogging=false]
 * When set to `true` it will disable IAB secure logging for the app.
 *
 * @property {boolean} [fdc3Api=false]
 * A flag to enable FDC3 API.  When set to `true` the `fdc3` API object is present for all windows
 *
 * @property {string} [loadErrorMessage="There was an error loading the application."]
 * An error message to display when the application (launched via manifest) fails to load.
 * A dialog box will be launched with the error message just before the runtime exits.
 * Load fails such as failed DNS resolutions or aborted connections as well as cancellations, _e.g.,_ `window.stop()`,
 * will trigger this dialog.
 * Client response codes such as `404 Not Found` are not treated as fails as they are valid server responses.
 *
 * @property {Window~options} [mainWindowOptions]
 * The options of the main window of the application.
 * For a description of these options, click the link (in the Type column).
 *
 * @property {number} [maxViewPoolSize=10]
 * Platforms Only.  The maximum number of "detached" or "pooled" Views that can exist in the Platform before being closed.
 * If you do not wish for views to be pooled on your platform, set this property to zero.
 *
 * @property {string} [name]
 * The name of the application (and the application's main window).
 *
 * If provided, _must_ match `uuid`.
 *
 * @property {boolean} [nonPersistent=false]
 * A flag to configure the application as non-persistent.
 * Runtime exits when there are no persistent apps running.
 *
 * @property {boolean} [plugins=false]
 * Enable Flash at the application level.
 *
 * @property {boolean} [spellCheck=false]
 * Enable spell check at the application level.
 *
 * @property {string} [url="about:blank"]
 * The url to the application (specifically the application's main window).
 *
 * @property {string} uuid
 * The _Unique Universal Identifier_ (UUID) of the application, unique within the set of all other applications
 *  running in the OpenFin Runtime.
 *
 * Note that `name` and `uuid` must match.
 *
 * @property {boolean} [webSecurity=true]
 * When set to `false` it will disable the same-origin policy for the app.
